# transport-heartbeat
A web application to visualize public transport in Melbourne Australia

## Summary

This is a project to map major public transport routes in Melbourne Australia and add a visual pulse when a departure occurs on the map. I thought it would be interesting to be able to see how public transport flows through a city.

I think it would also be cool to attach sound effects to different events so you could hear the "heartbeat" of the transport network.

It is just something I am playing around with when I have time.
